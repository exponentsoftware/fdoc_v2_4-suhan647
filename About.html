      <h2>History of Chikmagalur</h2>
      <p>Chikmagaluru is steeped in a rich and distinct history, just waiting to be explored. The history of Chikmagalur dates back to the medieval period. This little beautiful town in south-western part of Karnataka is captivated with several legends. One of such interesting stories is that the city was given as a dowry to the younger daughter of King Rukmangada. Therefore, Chikmagalur is derived from the Kannada word "Chikkamagala Uru" which means "Younger daughter's town".

        The other section of the city, Hiremagalur (short while ago a separate village, now falls under the area of Chikmagalur) was given to the  elder daughter. Nevertheless, ancient inscriptions give the low-down that the two places were known as Kiriya-muguli and Piriya-muguli in the olden days. Chikmagalur was also the birthplace for the earliest generations of the Hoysala dynasty where the kings governed their regions in southern part of the subcontinent. As a matter of fact, the Amriteshwara temple located at Amrithapura in Tarikere Taluk is built by the king of Hoysala dominion. In the rear, the territory, dropped into the clutches of Hyder Ali and handed down to his son Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore. In the modern history, Chikkamagaluru gained global attention, when the former Indian Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi was elected in Lok Sabha.</p>
