### Day 4

Create a responsive personal blog website using pure HTML and CSS. The website should have the following features:

1. A header with the blog title, a navigation menu, and a search bar. The navigation menu should include links to the "Home", "About", "Contact", and "Blog" sections of the website.

2. A main content area with a responsive grid layout that displays a list of blog post cards. Each card should have an image, title, publication date, and a short description. The grid should have 3 columns for large screens, 2 columns for medium screens, and 1 column for small screens.

3. A right sidebar with a list of popular posts, an author bio, and social media links.

4. A footer with copyright information and links to the "Home", "About", "Contact", and "Blog" sections.

5. Make sure to use semantic HTML elements and CSS Flexbox or Grid to create the responsive layout.

6. Add hover effects to buttons, links, and other interactive elements.

7. Ensure that the website is accessible and follows best practices for HTML and CSS.

Here's a basic outline of the HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Personal Blog</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <!-- Add your header content here -->
  </header>
  <main>
    <section class="content">
      <!-- Add your main content area here -->
    </section>
    <aside class="sidebar">
      <!-- Add your sidebar content here -->
    </aside>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <!-- Add your footer content here -->
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

Use this structure as a starting point and build the website with the specified features using your creativity and CSS skills.
